# SNOW-MAN-A-Minimalist-Lyrical-Player
SNOW MAN IS COMING SOON. 

Introducing SNOWMAN, a minimalist music/lyric player that utilizes Spotify and YouTube APIs to play your favorite lyrics on a simple, minimalist screen. This application is designed for individuals who prefer a minimal style while studying and want to listen to lyrics as they study. The online desktop application enables users to input their favorite songs and listen to the lyrics while enjoying a simple background. SNOWMAN can be used in various settings, such as small get-togethers or solo study sessions. This is the initial version of the app, and further development will be carried out on this open-source projectâ€™s GitHub. Stay tuned for more updates from the SNOW MAN team.
